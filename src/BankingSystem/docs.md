## Introduction
This simple banking system provides functionalities for creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking balances, transferring money, and displaying account details. The system is implemented using three main components:
- `Account` class
- `Bank` interface
- `Main` class

## Account Class
The `Account` class implements the `Bank` interface and manages account data including account IDs, names, and balances.

### Attributes
- `ids`: ArrayList<String> - Stores account IDs.
- `names`: ArrayList<String> - Stores account holder names.
- `balances`: ArrayList<Double> - Stores account balances.
- `accountCnt`: static int - Counts the number of accounts created.
- `r`: Random - Random number generator for creating account IDs.

### Methods
- **Constructor**: Initializes the attributes.
  ```java
  public Account()
  ```

- **createID(String name)**: Creates a unique account ID.
  ```java
  public String createID(String name)
  ```

- **addAccount(String name, double initialDeposit)**: Adds a new account and returns the account ID.
  ```java
  public String addAccount(String name, double initialDeposit)
  ```

- **deposit(String id, double amount)**: Deposits money into the specified account. Returns true if successful, otherwise false.
  ```java
  public boolean deposit(String id, double amount)
  ```

- **withdraw(String id, double amount)**: Withdraws money from the specified account. Returns true if successful, otherwise false.
  ```java
  public boolean withdraw(String id, double amount)
  ```

## Main Class

  ```java
  private static void deposit(Scanner sc)
  ```

- **withdraw(Scanner sc)**: Prompts the user to withdraw money from an account.
  ```java
  private static void withdraw(Scanner sc)
  ```

- **checkBalance(Scanner sc)**: Prompts the user to check the balance of an account.
  ```java
  private static void checkBalance(Scanner sc)
  ```

- **displayDetails(Scanner sc)**: Prompts the user to display the details of an account.

## Usage

- Errors such as invalid account IDs or insufficient funds are handled with appropriate messages to the user.

## Summary
This simple banking system provides basic functionalities for managing bank accounts, including creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking balances, transferring money, and displaying account details. The `Account` class implements the `Bank` interface, while the `Main` class provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs gracefully.
