Sure! Here's a roadmap you can follow to implement the simple banking system:

### Roadmap to Implement Simple Banking System

1. **Define the Account Class:**
   - Create a class named `Account`.
   - Define private fields for account number, account holder name, and balance.
   - Implement setter and getter methods for these fields to encapsulate access to the class attributes.
   - Implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the account balance.

2. **Create the Main Class:**
   - Create a class named `SimpleBankingSystem` as the main class.
   - Declare an `ArrayList` to store account objects.
   - Implement a `main` method to serve as the entry point for the application.

3. **Implement Account Management Functions:**
   - Implement a method to create a new account:
     - Prompt the user to enter the account holder name and initial balance.
     - Generate a unique account number for the new account.
     - Create an `Account` object with the provided details and add it to the `ArrayList` of accounts.
   - Implement methods to deposit and withdraw money:
     - Prompt the user to enter the account number and amount to deposit/withdraw.
     - Find the account with the provided account number.
     - Call the deposit/withdraw method of the account object.
   - Implement a method to check the account balance:
     - Prompt the user to enter the account number.
     - Find the account with the provided account number.
     - Display the account details including the current balance.

4. **Implement User Interface:**
   - Inside the `main` method, use a loop to repeatedly display a menu of options and prompt the user to choose an action.
   - Display options for creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and exiting the program.
   - Based on the user's choice, call the corresponding account management function.

5. **Test the Application:**
   - Thoroughly test each functionality to ensure that the application works as expected.
   - Test creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and checking balances.
   - Test edge cases such as depositing/withdrawing negative amounts, withdrawing more than the available balance, etc.

Following this roadmap will guide you through the implementation of the simple banking system step by step. It's important to test your code at each stage to ensure correctness and functionality.
